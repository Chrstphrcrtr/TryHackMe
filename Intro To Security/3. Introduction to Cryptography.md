<h2 align="center">Task-1 Introduction</h2>

Q. You have received the following encrypted message:

“Xjnvw lc sluxjmw jsqm wjpmcqbg jg wqcxqmnvw; xjzjmmjd lc wjpm sluxjmw jsqm bqccqm zqy.” Zlwvzjxj Zpcvcol

You can guess that it is a quote. Who said it?

### Step 1:

We will navigate over to [quipqiup](https://www.quipqiup.com) which is a fast and automated cryptogram solver by Edwin Olson.

### Step 2:

Insert the encrypted message and click solve.

### Step 3:

We see there are several results but the only result that makes a sense is result 0. Leaving us with the answer to "who said it" which would be `Miyamoto Musashi`

<h2 align="center">Task-2 Symmetric Encryption</h2>

Q. Decrypt the file quote01 encrypted (using AES256) with the key s!kR3T55 using gpg. What is the third word in the file?

### Step 1:

We will open the attack box and we can access the files under /root/Rooms/cryptographyintro/task02
