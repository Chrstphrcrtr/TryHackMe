<h2 align="center">Task-1 Introduction</h2>

Q. You have received the following encrypted message:

“Xjnvw lc sluxjmw jsqm wjpmcqbg jg wqcxqmnvw; xjzjmmjd lc wjpm sluxjmw jsqm bqccqm zqy.” Zlwvzjxj Zpcvcol

You can guess that it is a quote. Who said it?

### Step 1:

We will navigate over to [quipqiup](https://www.quipqiup.com) which is a fast and automated cryptogram solver by Edwin Olson.

### Step 2:

Insert the encrypted message and click solve.

### Step 3:

We see there are several results but the only result that makes a sense is result 0. Leaving us with the answer to "who said it" which would be `Miyamoto Musashi`

<h2 align="center">Task-2 Symmetric Encryption</h2>

Q. Decrypt the file quote01 encrypted (using AES256) with the key s!kR3T55 using gpg. What is the third word in the file?

### Step 1:

We will open the attack box and we can access the files under /root/Rooms/cryptographyintro/task02

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/359c37d0-2f6c-4a60-a457-73305c5c50aa">

### Step 2:

We will decrypt `quote01.txt.gpg` using the Gpg command: `gpg --output Question1.txt --decrypt quote01.txt.gpg`

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/44b128fe-16cf-4401-b98e-4d3354408296">

### Step 3: 

After entering the command we are prompted with a passphrase which is provided to us in the question. Enter the passphrase `s!kR3T55` and we can see our Question1.txt is now outputted.

### Step 4: 

Open the decrypted file

The third word in the file is `waste`

Q. Decrypt the file quote02 encrypted (using AES256-CBC) with the key s!kR3T55 using openssl. What is the third word in the file?

### Step 1:

Quote02 can be found in the same directory as the previous question

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/83fbbff5-cb4e-4412-922c-6edb8b1e1ccd">

### Step 2:

For this file we will be using openssl command to decrypt the file. Enter the command: `openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in quote02 -out Question2` and just like the previous question the passphrase will be `s!kR3T55`

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/ee013624-39f9-4d4b-b342-e178b334f67b">

### Step 3:

Open the decrypted file 

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/daf1f5bd-21cd-44aa-a248-60cb4fecf1a8">

The third word is `Science`

Q. Decrypt the file quote03 encrypted (using CAMELLIA256) with the key s!kR3T55 using gpg. What is the third word in the file?

### Step 1:
The final quote for this task is located in the same directory as the previous 2 questions.
