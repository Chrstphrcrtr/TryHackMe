<h2 align="center">Task-1 Introduction</h2>

Q. You have received the following encrypted message:

“Xjnvw lc sluxjmw jsqm wjpmcqbg jg wqcxqmnvw; xjzjmmjd lc wjpm sluxjmw jsqm bqccqm zqy.” Zlwvzjxj Zpcvcol

You can guess that it is a quote. Who said it?

### Step 1:

We will navigate over to [quipqiup](https://www.quipqiup.com) which is a fast and automated cryptogram solver by Edwin Olson.

### Step 2:

Insert the encrypted message and click solve.

### Step 3:

We see there are several results but the only result that makes sense is result 0. Leaving us with the answer to "who said it" which would be `Miyamoto Musashi`

<h2 align="center">Task-2 Symmetric Encryption</h2>

Q. Decrypt the file quote01 encrypted (using AES256) with the key s!kR3T55 using gpg. What is the third word in the file?

### Step 1:

We will open the attack box and we can access the files under /root/Rooms/cryptographyintro/task02

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/359c37d0-2f6c-4a60-a457-73305c5c50aa">

### Step 2:

We will decrypt `quote01.txt.gpg` using the Gpg command: `gpg --output Question1.txt --decrypt quote01.txt.gpg`

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/44b128fe-16cf-4401-b98e-4d3354408296">

### Step 3: 

After entering the command we are prompted with a passphrase which is provided to us in the question. Enter the passphrase `s!kR3T55` and we can see our Question1.txt is now outputted.

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/8e624a63-2db2-4396-996d-f3ce047629e4">

### Step 4: 

Open the decrypted file

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/a595cf13-4478-4ee7-970c-1a45de412040">


The third word in the file is `waste`

Q. Decrypt the file quote02 encrypted (using AES256-CBC) with the key s!kR3T55 using openssl. What is the third word in the file?

### Step 1:

Quote02 can be found in the same directory as the previous question

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/83fbbff5-cb4e-4412-922c-6edb8b1e1ccd">

### Step 2:

For this file we will be using openssl command to decrypt the file. Enter the command: `openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in quote02 -out Question2` and just like the previous question the passphrase will be `s!kR3T55`

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/ee013624-39f9-4d4b-b342-e178b334f67b">

### Step 3:

Open the decrypted file 

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/daf1f5bd-21cd-44aa-a248-60cb4fecf1a8">

The third word is `Science`

Q. Decrypt the file quote03 encrypted (using CAMELLIA256) with the key s!kR3T55 using gpg. What is the third word in the file?

### Step 1:
The final quote for this task is located in the same directory as the previous 2 questions.

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/beaa25c3-b01a-48b0-930f-cd33949a0d68">

### Step 2:

We can confirm that we have CAMELLLIA256 with the command `gpg --version`

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/c9f02977-46c9-4d9a-8930-81fd3783e4a6">

### Step 3:

Use the command: `gpg --output Question3 --decrypt quote03.txt.gpg` and use the passphrase `s!kR3T55` to fully decrypt the file. 

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/7b0d0d36-4c9e-4d39-acf4-cc763e6d32cc">

### Step 4:

Open the decrypted file

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/ee283b7c-1f1b-4a06-bdb0-d884e3478f86">

The third word is `understand`

<h2 align="center">Task-3 Asymmetric Encryption</h2>

Q. Bob has received the file ciphertext_message sent to him from Alice. You can find the key you need in the same folder. What is the first word of the original plaintext?

### Step 1:

You can find the directory for this task located at /root/Rooms/cryptographyintro/task03

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/c4cb0c62-816e-49b9-8d87-db63ccc8d552">


### Step 2:

To decipher Bob's file we will be using the openssl command: `openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -in ciphertext_message -inkey private-key-bob.pem -out Question1`

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/9aeebb60-a0c9-4966-b999-9caed50d1298">

### Step 3:

Open the decrypted file

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/627c2bfc-b01d-4c30-8ffa-6b8052df93e8">

The first word is `Perception`

Q. Take a look at Bob’s private RSA key. What is the last byte of p?

### Step 1:

Using the same file for Bob we can look at the bytes of it using command: `openssl rsa -in private-key-bob.pem -text -noout`

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/80df8458-f55d-4c58-87c9-ace761a0d8be">

### Step 2: 

Scroll down and find Prime 1, which represents P.

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/f7e19bae-90ea-4e8b-a44b-17aff0b8c667">

The last byte of P is `e7`

Q. Take a look at Bob’s private RSA key. What is the last byte of q?

Right below Prime 1 is Prime 2, which represents Q.

The last byte of Q is `27`

<h2 align="center">Task-4 Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange</h2>

Q. A set of Diffie-Hellman parameters can be found in the file dhparam.pem. What is the size of the prime number in bits?

### Step 1:

You can find the directory for this task located at /root/Rooms/cryptographyintro/task04

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/a939cf57-d891-47a1-bf95-5095a3c75666">

### Step 2:

We can view the prime number P and the generator G using the command `openssl dhparam -in dhparams.pem -text -noout`. (This is similar to what we did with the RSA private key.)

<img width="837" alt="TryHackMe" src="https://github.com/Chrstphrcrtr/TryHackMe/assets/156831678/f8bf612e-5952-4bc9-9fb6-238e52a0729e">

The size of the prime number in bits is `4096`

Q. What is the prime number’s last byte (least significant byte)?

The prime number's last byte is `4f`

<h2 align="center">Task-5 Hashing</h2>

Q. What is the SHA256 checksum of the file order.json?

### Step 1:

You can find the directory for this task located at /root/Rooms/cryptographyintro/task05
